It would infect the hosts computer when a pirate copy of the software was used but unexpectedly would infect any other disk inserted into the system afterwards. This would make the virus spread to a new computer whenever someone used one of the infected disks which went undetected and spread globally within a few months severely slowing down productivty and impacting business operations.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1988, the Morris worm came to be which was developed by Robert Morris as a program to assess the size of the internet. The program crawled the web and installed itself onto computers to get a count of computers that were coneccted to the internet, but, it failed to keep track of already compromised computers and kept re-installing itself until the computers ran out of memory and crashed. The worm affected 10% of the internet at the time, around 6000 computers. After the Morris worm, Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) were established to respond to computer security incidents.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow in the digital age and with the expansion of high-speed internet and computers connected to the internet, malware can now be spread through the internet with no need of physical disks to spread viruses.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2000, Onel De Guzman created the LoveLetter malware to steal internet login credentials.
